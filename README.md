# About-Me
# 👋 Hi, I'm John Jerry

I'm a passionate Data Scientist and AI Developer currently pursuing my MSc in Data Science at CHRIST University, Bangalore 🇮🇳. I specialize in building intelligent, end-to-end data solutions that combine analytics, automation, and AI for real-world impact.

## 🚀 What Drives Me

🔍 **Problem-Solver at Heart**  
I enjoy solving complex problems—whether it's detecting software bugs using transformer models or building dashboards that bring data to life.

🧠 **AI & ML Enthusiast**  
From Natural Language Processing to Machine Learning pipelines and LLMs like CodeBERT and Whisper, I’m constantly exploring ways to build smarter systems.

📊 **BI Storyteller**  
Using tools like Power BI, I transform raw datasets into executive dashboards and narrative reports that answer: *What is happening?* and *What will happen next?*
